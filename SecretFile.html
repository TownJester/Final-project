        Congratulations! You got access to the logs. Unfortunately, this ARG website will remain unfinshied. There were a lot of features I would have liked to add, but sadly I did not have the time or means for those additions. This was always meant to be a proof of concept. I'm adding this note as both a reminder to myself, and to make the ARG end more satisfying. More importantly, I want to give credit to my friends for creating the creatues for the log. The majority of the creatures were made by my friends and I would not have finished this without them.

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>
        I did not have a concrete story when starting this website, but I had a few ideas where I wanted to take it. The major idea was playing with a false person or world. The first creature in the creature logs reflect this. So does the codes that are found with the contacts. The main idea was that one of the researchers is either sent to a false world or replaced by a false self. I would have liked to expand on this idea if I continued with the websites. I also would have hid more secrets inside the website if I had more time. Either way I had fun playing around with the idea.
