HTML Final Notes:

Code is not yet finished and I need to add content. It is also very ugly at the moment. I'll be fixing that soon.
The first page is named Final_Project for now. It is the main page and navigation to the other pages. 
Contacts can be found down near the footer and it will hold the password to access the forms.

Creature info is empty right now, but there will be content soon. Information about different creatures in the ARG will be found here.
It will be multimedia page with images, sounds, text, and videos. 

Logs will be... well logs. It will be the start of the story, but for this project I will end it here.
Before accessing there will be a form that requires a password. This will introduce the gimick of an ARG,
Still code and content is unfinished for now.
everything will be cleaned up.
